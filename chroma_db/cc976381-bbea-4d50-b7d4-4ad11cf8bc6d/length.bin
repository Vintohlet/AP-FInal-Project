While I wouldn\u2019t pay $200/month to test this early version of Operator (https://bgr.com/tech/chatgpt-operator-is-brilliant-but-its-not-worth-200-month/) , what I saw in the OpenAI demos blew my mind. Operator is miles ahead of Google\u2019s AI agents, at least when it comes to demos. I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on it once OpenAI brings it to other ChatGPT paid tiers, and, more crucially for me personally, to the EU. However, the real AI story taking over the world isn\u2019t ChatGPT, Operator, or the massive Stargate project that was announced last week. The DeepSeek (https://bgr.com/tag/deepseek/) AI story took over the world when the Chinese startup released its R1 reasoning model that can match OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT o1. There\u2019s nothing surprising about that; we expect other AI firms to match o1. After all, OpenAI already unveiled o3, which should be announced in a few days or weeks. What\u2019s unusual about DeepSeek is that the Chinese company made its models open-source, so any company or developer can access and inspect them. More interesting is the R1 research paper (https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf) that DeepSeek released, which claims the highly sophisticated model was trained at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI\u2019s o1. News that DeepSeek R1 training is possible with only 3% to 5% of the resources OpenAI needs for similar progress with ChatGPT made waves around the world. AI-related stocks tanked (https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-deepseek-ai-chip-selloff-9a1c1a77) during Monday\u2019s early trading, just as DeepSeek surged (https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/chinese-ai-startup-deepseek-overtakes-chatgpt-apple-app-store-2025-01-27/) to become #1 in the App Store, surpassing ChatGPT.

(https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/) One of the problems with the current AI software concerns the cost of developing and using the product. Advanced models like o1 can cost tens of millions to develop. The process requires high-end graphics cards (GPU) that provide the necessary computing power and energy expenditures. That\u2019s why finished products like ChatGPT o1 can\u2019t be available for free without limitations. Companies like OpenAI need to cover costs and turn a profit. That\u2019s why the massive $500 billion Stargate program is such a monumental decision for AI development, especially considering the inevitable AI arms race between the US and China. Add the US sanctions that prevent China from accessing the same high-end chips and GPUs that make the development of ChatGPT o1 products possible, and you\u2019d think ChatGPT, Gemini, Meta AI, and Claude can\u2019t get significant competition from China. That\u2019s where DeepS
